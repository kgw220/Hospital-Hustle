# Hospital-Hustle
This is a project using ArcGIS to analyze shooting data from ArcGIS REST APIs to see the proximity of shootings to nearby hospitals.

I completed this project mostly via ArcGIS Online. I could not find a way to export the map layers, but if I do, they will be attached.

The results and visualizations of my analysis are posted to a public ArcGIS story map, linked below:
